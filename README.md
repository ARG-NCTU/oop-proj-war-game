# WarGame Competition
Our goal is to make bots that compete in a halo-inspired global war game using Python!   
You will be responsible for developing the strategy your bot will use to conquer the battlefield.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop an understanding of intermediate Python. This includes getting full use of the standard library, writing more pythonic code, learning about classes, and much more!

- Become confident in your ability to develop python programs

## Tools and Technologies

[Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as the language of choice.

[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted/) as our optional visualizer.

## Getting started
Using docker environment:
```bash
$ source docker_run.sh # get into docker env
$ python3 main.py # start the game
```

In one step:
```bash
# get into docker env 
# and run the main.py script automatically
$ source docker_main.sh 
```

## Or build your own environment
`poetry` or `virtualenv` is recommended.  
The corresponding dependency list is provided (`pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`)
